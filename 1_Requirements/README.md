ABOUT AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE AND ITS HISTORY

The term ATM stands for automated teller machine. It is an electronic device that is used by only bank customers to process account transactions. The users access their accounts through a special type of plastic card that is encoded with user information on a magnetic strip. The strip contains an identification code that is transmitted to the bank’s central computer by modem. The users insert the card into ATMs to access the account and process their account transactions. The automated teller machine was invented by John Shepherd-Barron in the year 1960. This article discusses an overview of the automated teller machine (ATM).

The first ATM concept arose in different countries like Japan, the UK, Sweden & the US. So, Japan invented the Machine for Computer Loan that is called a computer load machine to supply cash. This device was used in the year1966.

After some developments, the initial cash dispensing machine was developed by Britain, in London, 1967. This machine was first used by “Barclays Bank” which is located in Enfield Town of North London. This machine was developed by the firm De La Rue & John Shepherd-Barron. This was the essential point for current ATMs.

In India, the development of ATMs was very slow because they were launched in the early 1990s to the Indians and assisted through foreign banks.

When most of the banks were facing severe problems because of the lack of a strong branch system, then automated teller machines appeared like the best solution to these problems.

The ATM machine was implemented to reduce the obstructions of the branch networking by reaching out to the customers by offering comfortable services with fewer transaction charges. After that, many improvements in this technology have arrived & also customer accessibility has also improved through boundaries.
